# Miner Havoc

Miner Havoc is a simple python based script meant to scan the whole internet for Etherum Mining devices as well 
as some bitcoin mining based devices running on default credentials ... 

It bruteforces its way in and once it confirms that the device is running on default credentials defined it stores
the IP of the device along with its credentials in a log file

Just a simple POC of current scenarios
